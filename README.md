# decision-kit

Tree-based library, with branching criteria based on Gini impurity. At the moment only the CART decision tree and a RandomForest based on it are implemented.

For each class, a directory containing a mockup using the model has been included. (*purely for demonstration purposes without regard to the analysis of the data used*)
